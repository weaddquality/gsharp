* To start developing, use LabVIEW>>open, point to proj file (C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2017\resource\Framework\Providers\addq\G#IDE\AddQ_G#IDE.lvproj). Do not use repo path, will lead to crosslinking.

* Password to the password-protected files of the IDE are found in Doc/PWG#.txt. Use the last password.

* For every change, edit /Installer/G# Framework ReadMe.txt

* Use LinkToRepo.bat (in the /Doc) to create a symbolic link to the G# repository from the installed locations of G#. Use UnlinkFromRepo.bat to unlink.

* To test changes, use "Doc/start LV instance 1.bat" to run a second instance of LabVIEW.

* To build a VIPM-installer, see the readme in the VIPM-folder. VIPM-files cannot link to anything inside the LabVIEW-folder.

* Project provider documentation is in Doc/NI
